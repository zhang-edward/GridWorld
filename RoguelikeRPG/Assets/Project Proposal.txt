Project Proposal:
-----------------

The game will be a roguelike-RPG fantasy style game in which the player is in a world with towns,
dungeons, monsters, and different terrain to traverse. The purpose of the game is to make your
character stronger and more influential on the events that occur in the world that you are in.
This can be achieved by completing quests given by the towns, defeating monsters and conquering dungeons,
or acquiring new and more powerful equipment. If the player chooses, he or she may travel to another world
through a portal and start again.

The player has two main stats:
Good vs Evil
Life vs Death

In addition, there are three categories of stats, items, and spells:

Wisdom - Mage (Spell)
         Possible Spells: Fire, Ice, Lightning, Invisibility, Invincibility
                          Stunning, Earth, Summoning monsters(dragons, snakes, etc.)
Strength - Warrior (Physical)
           Possible Weapons: Sword, Axe, Mace, Shield, Bomb,

Dexterity - Ranger (Stealth, Ranged)
            Possible Weapons: Crossbow, Longbow, Camaflouge cloak, knife,
                              Different types of arrows(poison, fire, etc.)
            Can have pets to do stuff for them(eagle, wolf, etc.) such as steal items

As you level up, you can choose to increase skill level in which ever skill you want.
You buy weapons for warrior and ranger and magic scrolls for mage.
You can only use a weapon when the skill it corresponds with has reached a certain level.
